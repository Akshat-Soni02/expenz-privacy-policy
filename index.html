    <h1>Privacy Policy for ExpenZ</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: 6th June, 2025</div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how ExpenZ ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares personal information of users ("you") of the ExpenZ mobile application (the "App"). The App is designed to help individuals register and manage their expenses, split amounts with friends, add personal transactions, create and manage splits within groups, utilize virtual wallets for transactions, and manage bills. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This policy aims to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our data handling practices, reflecting our dedication to transparency and building trust. Our practices are designed to comply with applicable data privacy laws and regulations, including those set forth by Google Play, ensuring that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with your rights.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect various types of information from you to provide, maintain, and improve the App's functionality and user experience. The information we collect depends on how you interact with the App and the features you use.</p>

    <h3>2.1. Information You Provide Directly to Us</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Registration Information:</b> When you register an account with the App, you may do so through Google or via email and password. If you choose to register via email, we collect your email address and a password. If you register through Google, we may collect your name, email address, and profile picture associated with your Google account. Providing an email address is necessary to create an account and access the App across different devices. You may also have the option to provide a phone number, which can be used for account recovery and added security. This information allows us to identify you as a user and provide you with access to the App's features. </li>
      <li><b>Transaction Data:</b> When you use the App to add personal transactions or split amounts with friends, we collect details about these transactions. This includes the amount, date, description, and category of the expense. If you are splitting an amount with friends, we will collect information about the friends involved, which may include their names, email addresses, phone numbers, or internal identifiers within the App if they are also users. For group splits, we collect the names of the groups you create and the members within those groups.</li>
      <li><b>Wallet Information:</b> The App allows you to create virtual wallets to organize your finances. When you create and use these wallets, we collect the names and descriptions you provide for your wallets, as well as the transaction history associated with each wallet. </li>
      <li><b>Bill Management Data:</b> If you use the App's bill management features, we collect information about the bills you add, such as the bill name, amount, due date, and recurrence settings. You may also set up reminders and notification preferences for these bills, which are stored within the App. </li>
      <li><b>Communications:</b> If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Device Information:</b> We automatically collect certain information about the device you use to access the App. This includes your IP address, mobile device ID number, model, and manufacturer, the version of your operating system, browser type (if accessing via a web interface), the App version, and language settings. This automatic collection helps us ensure the App functions correctly on your device, provides security for your account, and allows us to analyze usage patterns to improve the App. </li>
      <li><b>Usage Data:</b> We collect information about how you interact with the App. This includes the features you use, the actions you take within the App (e.g., taps, scrolls), and the frequency and duration of your usage. We may also collect crash reports and performance data to identify and fix issues.
 </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. Information from Third-Party Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you choose to register or log in to the App using your Google account, we may collect your name, email address, and potentially your profile picture from Google. This integration streamlines the registration process and allows you to connect with friends who also use the App. This data is treated as if you provided it directly to us.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>To Provide and Maintain the App:</b> This includes creating and managing your account, enabling expense tracking, facilitating expense splitting, managing virtual wallets, and handling bill reminders.</li>
      <li><b>To Improve and Personalize Your Experience:</b> We use usage data and feedback to understand user behavior, identify areas for improvement, develop new features, and personalize the App's interface and recommendations.</li>
      <li><b>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</b> We use device information and usage data to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, unauthorized access, and other security incidents, ensuring the integrity of your account and our services.</li>
      <li><b>For Analytics and Performance Monitoring:</b> We analyze aggregated and anonymized data to monitor the App's performance, understand trends, and make informed business decisions.</li>
      <li><b>To Communicate with You:</b> We may use your email address to send you important updates about the App, policy changes, security alerts, and to respond to your inquiries.</li>
      <li><b>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</b> We may use your information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>With Other Users:</b> When you split expenses or create groups, certain information (like your name, profile picture, and the amounts owed/paid) will be visible to the friends or group members involved to facilitate the core functionality of the App.</li>
      <li><b>With Service Providers:</b> We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, analytics, customer support, and IT services. These service providers are obligated to protect your information and only use it for the purposes for which it was disclosed.</li>
      <li><b>For Legal Reasons:</b> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>
      <li><b>In Case of Business Transfers:</b> In the event that ExpenZ is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, dissolution, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our App of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
      <li><b>With Your Consent:</b> We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We implement a variety of security measures, including technical, administrative, and physical safeguards, to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Access Controls:</b> Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel who need to access it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li><b>Regular Security Reviews:</b> We regularly review our security practices to ensure they remain effective and up-to-date with evolving threats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

    </ul>
